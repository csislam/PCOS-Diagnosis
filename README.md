This project is part of an ongoing research initiative on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) diagnosis using patient history datasets. The work focuses on statistical feature selection, optimized sampling strategies, and advanced machine learning models to address the challenges of class imbalance and high-dimensional clinical features. By evaluating multiple machine learning approaches—including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)—the study identifies the most reliable framework for classifying PCOS across diverse patient groups and varying conditions.

The proposed framework leverages optimized sampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE, undersampling, hybrid approaches) alongside robust feature selection to minimize bias and improve generalization. XGBoost was chosen as the primary model for its ability to handle non-linear relationships, missing values, and imbalanced data effectively.

Key Contributions

•	Developed a feature-optimized XGBoost pipeline for accurate PCOS detection.

•	Integrated sampling strategies to mitigate dataset imbalance.

•	Compared classical and ensemble ML models to benchmark performance.

•	Achieved improved diagnostic accuracy with interpretable results supporting clinical decision-making.
